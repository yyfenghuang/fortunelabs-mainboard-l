/**

 * @brief WiFi Station and MQTT Network Manager
 *
 * Resilient network layer for ESP32: brings up the TCP/IP stack and WiFi
 * station mode, connects to an MQTT broker, and auto-reconnects on
 * disconnect for both WiFi and MQTT. Not a vtable-based driver; there is
 * exactly one network implementation, accessed via direct function calls.
 *
 * Owns three MQTT topics per device, derived from device_id at init:
 * telemetry (periodic sensor publish), command (inbound control,
 * subscribed on connect), and health (outbound status, including LWT).
